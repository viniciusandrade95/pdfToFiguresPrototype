# From PDF to Figures – Prototype

This prototype aims to explore how AI tools can support the extraction and processing of structured quantitative content (e.g., tables, figures, numeric summaries) from annual reports and similar content in PDF format.

The goal is to enable downstream use of this information for analysis, data validation, or integration into other statistical processes.

## 📌 Status

This prototype is currently under early development. More information about the architecture, chosen technologies, and implementation approach will be added here as the work progresses.

## Installation

Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in order to install the required packages.

## Execution

Run the command `python app.py` in order to execute the main program.
